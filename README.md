# HookemTutorialPart2
The purpose of this repo is to be cloned to follow an Android workshop on Parse SDK.  
This is part 2 of the workshop. PARSE Sign Up and mostly all the structure of the app is already implemented.
We still have to implement Login, FriendRequests, and PushNotifications from the server.
The app is called Hookem, which is an Android app that allow users to send "Hookem" push notifications to other users.
